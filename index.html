            <p>I get lost in creative tasks.
                 I’ll skip lunch if I’m deeply engaged in making something, ignore texts if I’m thinking about how to tackle a design challenge, and sketch out ideas in my mind as I fall asleep at night.
                <br>
                <br>
                 My formal education in fine arts, anthropology, and environmental education has driven me to lend my creative skills to advancing social causes. After nearly 10 years working in nonprofits and sustainability in higher education, I discovered my passion for user-centered ideation, problem-solving, and visual design – putting a name to the work I get lost in. 
                <br>
                <br> 
                What I like most about design is how it can alter the way you feel about the products you use and the experiences you participate in. Whether I’m designing graphics and print materials, user interfaces for websites and mobile applications, or educational programs for learners of all ages – the throughline is a deep desire to think creatively, tell stories through a visual medium, and bring ideas to fruition. 
                <br>
                <br>
                In my free time, I am a crafter and maker -- I sew, knit, cook, ferment, and build. I love hiking, biking, and exploring new places abroad and at home in New York City.
